# PrayerRipple — static site

A super-simple static site suitable for GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a public repo named `prayerripple` (or any name).
2. Add these files to the repo root (index.html must be in the root).
3. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/ (root)`.
4. Visit your Pages URL (e.g., https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/) and connect your custom domain in **Pages → Custom domain**.
5. Update the App Store / Play Store links and the Admin Login URL in `index.html`.

## Customize
- Replace `assets/app-mock.png` with real screenshots.
- Replace `assets/logo.svg` and `assets/favicon.svg` with your brand assets.
- Edit `privacy.html` and `terms.html` with real policies.
